	<p>Generate tables of modular arithmetic with shading of absolute values.
	Hold ctrl and press - until you zoom out to see the pattern.
	The format is column index modulo row index.
	Keep your memory and processing power in mind when scrolling and zooming for large limits, as (2(limit)+2)^2 cells with as many shades as the limit are rendered.
	Limits over 100 can crash, so the input is capped at 150 for now. 
	50 is a good starting point, 100 is my sweet spot, and 150 is appealing if you are careful and considerate with your use of the mouse and keyboard.
	I have looked at 255, which is gorgeous, but I am trying to prevent browser crashes for unaware users. Lower values have similar appeal.
